## Limitation on the scripts
For the scripts there is a sync needed from the target to HelloID. For example a sync from the local Active Directory to HelloID. Not every target systeem can synchrochize to HelloID. At the moment only two different target systems (AD and AAD) are tested to correctly sync with the HelloID Directory.

## User information
With the local CSV export, you can make a report that gives insight into the current situation in the Active Directory. The exported data can be input for the business rules yet
to be created.

### Get-HelloIDRoleModel
This script is used by small organizations. This overview offers insight into memberships by department or function. This overview doesn’t give roles across departments of functions.

### Get-HelloIDPersonGroupMembers
This script is used by middle to big organizations. This overview offers insight into the memberships of the employees of the organizations. If the CSV export is turned into a pivot table, several reports can be made.

## Script outcome
After configuring and running the "Get-HelloIDRoleModel.ps1" or "Get-HelloIDPersonGroupMembers.ps1" script, the following outcome will be automatically generated. 
-   CSV file on a configured local location. 
-   Export data to an HTML path (only with Get-HelloIDRoleModel)

## PowerShell setup script
The PowerShell scripts “Get-HelloIDRoleModel.ps1” and "Get-HelloIDPersonGroupMembers.ps1" contains a complete PowerShell script using the HelloID API to create a report for RoleMining purposes. Please follow the steps below to set up and run the “Get-HelloIDRoleModel.ps1” PowerShell script in your environment. 
1. Set up a sync to the HelloID Directory. There are two different target systems that are available Active Directory or Azure Active Directory.
   - Local Active Directory: Set up a “[Synchronize AD](https://docs.helloid.com/hc/en-us/articles/360001592994)” automated task in Automation > Tasks 
   - AzureAD (only AAD)
   Enable synchronization with AAD "[Synchronize AAD] (https://docs.helloid.com/hc/en-us/articles/360019160119-Enable-or-disable-Azure-AD-synchronization)" 
   Because the sync with AAD doesn’t bring the EmployeeId to the HelloID Users. For the script HelloID needs an EmployeeId to correlate the persons and accounts. With "[Sync AzureAD-EmployeeId-HelloID-Users] https://github.com/Tools4everBV/HelloID-Conn-SA-Source-Sync-AzureAD-EmployeeId-HelloID-Users" the EmployeeId can be synced to the HelloID Users. 
2.  Download the " Get-HelloIDRoleModel.ps1" file
3.  Open it in your favorite PowerShell console/editor
4.  Create a HelloID [API key and secret](https://docs.helloid.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002008873-API-Keys-Overview)
5.  Update the connection and configuration details in the script's header
6.  Run the script on a machine with PowerShell support and an internet connection
